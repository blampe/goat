Regarding the above:
  1. Dots  – requested with "*" or "o" – are centered on an XyIndex cell, as seen from
     coord frame within final SVG space (as offset by <g transform='translate(8,16)'>)
  2. "Dots" create a special case by exerting claims on
     *three* horizontally adjacent XyIndex cells,
     because they are centered on a cell, and extend into left and right neighbors.
     Input .txt-file neighbors left and right must therefore contain only blank space.
  3. The SVG space transform accommodates the double-width, allowing a Dot in the first .txt
     column to escape clipping of its left edge.
  4. XX XX   The Y-axis of the translation transform is more than necessary – there
     is an always-blank band at the top of SVG image.   
  5. Text elements <text> get an inline Y-offset of +4 – visually necessary for Y-alignment
     with Dots to left or right – But why so?   
  6. XyIndex method AsPixel() Pixel returns the SVG 'px' coordinate of the cell
     center (within the transformed space)
