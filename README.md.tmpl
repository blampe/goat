# GoAT: Go ASCII Tool

## What **GoAT** Can Do For You

- From a chunky ASCII-art source drawing, render polished, graphically-rich [SVG](#complicated),
  with the [goat](./cmd/goat) CLI command.

- Tie together all three of:
  1. Your code's major data structures or abstract data/control flows.
  2. Related ASCII-art diagrams embedded in comments, adjacent to the source code.
  3. Polished line diagrams in your user-facing high-level documentation, with inline links
     to SVG produced by [goat](./cmd/goat).
     For Markdown or similar formats, links may be expanded either at build-time or run-time,
     as needed by your doc tool suite.

  Your ASCII-art source persists as the single-point-of-truth, revision-controlled along with
  the code that embeds it.
  This README contains an [example](#library-data-flow).

## You Will Also Need

#### Graphical- or Rectangle-oriented text editing capability
Both **vim** and **emacs** offer useful support.
In Emacs, see the built-in rectangle-editing commands, and ```picture-mode```.

#### A fixed-pitch font with 2:1 height:width ratio as presented by your editor and terminal emulator
Most fixed-pitch or "monospace" Unicode fonts maintain a 2:1 aspect ratio for
characters in the ASCII range,
and all GoAT drawing characters are ASCII.
However, certain Unicode graphical characters e.g. MIDDLE DOT may be useful, and
conform to the width of the ASCII range.

CJK characters on the other hand are typically wider than 2:1.
Non-standard width characters are not in general composable on the left-right axis within a plain-text
drawing, because the remainder of the line of text to their right is pushed out of alignment
with rows above and below.

## Installation
```
$ go install github.com/{{.GithubUser}}/goat/cmd/goat@latest
```

## Examples

Here are some snippets of
GoAT-formatted UTF-8
and the SVG each can generate.
The SVG you see below was linked to by
inline Markdown image references

GoAT's [README.md](README.md), then finally rendered to HTML ```<img>``` elements by Github's Markdown processor

## The GoAT Library

The core engine of ```goat``` is accessible as a Go library package, for inclusion in specialized
code of your own.
The code implements a subset, and some extensions, of the ASCII diagram generation function of the browser-side Javascript in [Markdeep](http://casual-effects.com/markdeep/).

### library Data Flow
![]({{.Root}}/goat.svg)

The diagram above was derived by [./make.sh](./make.sh) from ASCII-art in the Go
source file [./goat.go](./goat.go).

#### Project Tenets

1. Utility and ease of integration into existing projects are paramount.
2. Compatibility with MarkDeep desired, but not required.
3. TXT and SVG intelligibility are co-equal in priority.
4. Composability of TXT not to be sacrificed -- only width-8 characters allowed.
5. Per-platform support limited to a single widely-available fixed-pitch TXT font.
